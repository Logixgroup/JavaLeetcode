String a = "Hello";
String b = "Hello";
String c = a;
a = new String("Hello");

System.out.println(a == b);
System.out.println(a.equals(b));
System.out.println("Result =" + c.equals(b));
System.out.println(c == b);

/* 
Step-by-step memory behavior

1. "Hello" is in String pool
Both a and b initially point to the same pooled object.


2. c = a;
→ c also points to the same pooled object.


3. a = new String("Hello");
→ Now a refers to a new object in heap, not pool.



Outputs

Statement	Explanation	Output

a == b	a → heap object, b → pool object	false
a.equals(b)	Compares values	true
"Result =" + c.equals(b)	c → pooled "Hello", b → pooled "Hello"	Result =true
c == b	Both still point to same pooled string	true
