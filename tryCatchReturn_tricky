/* 
Every method call in Java creates a stack frame on the thread stack.

A stack frame contains:

Local variables

Operand stack

Return address

A slot to hold return value (for all non-void methods) When you execute a return:

Step 1 → The return value is pushed onto the operand stack.This is the temporary holding area.
Step 2 → JVM records that the method is about to return. But does not exit the method yet.
Step 3 → Before returning, the JVM MUST execute the finally block. Even if finally modifies variables,
the return value on the operand stack is NOT recalculated.
Step 4 → After finally completes, the value from the operand stack is used as the actual return value.*/
